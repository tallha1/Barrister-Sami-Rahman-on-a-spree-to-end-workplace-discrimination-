<br>

We came across the luckiest chance to interview and know about the ongoing sensation <a href="https://iamsamirahman.com/" style="text-color:black">Barrister Sami Rahman</a>. 
In the heart of London, our barrister is getting up everyday to put on his best and go to his workplace (the courts) to end workplace discrimination in every other workplace. 
<a href="https://iamsamirahman.com/" style="text-color:black"><br>Where does he get his inspiration from? </a>
<br>
“I have come from very humble beginnings and seen it all,” he said. “Workplace discrimination is a huge societal issue happening right under our noses under this capitalist era and is plaguing the societies, setting the wrong standards for the upcoming workforces. It might almost lead to slavery again. It is our duty to end and protect the sanctity of workplaces as a divergence of cultures and talents.”
Workplace discrimination – how does it happen? 
•	Allowing people of certain cultures and ethnicities to replace workers of the so-called lesser races and creeds. 
•	Ignoring the mental health and capacities of individuals to accommodate the boss culture, leading to elevated personal issues with the sufferers. 
•	Firing – yes, firing the people who stand up against discrimination. A cruel thing to make someone to question their sanctity and potential just because they stood up, right? 
“How do you respond to fiery corporate tactics against your stand for workplace discrimination?” we asked the barrister. 
“It is a routine. Corporations have to be very careful about their reputations therefore it is pertinent for the counsels to examine all the situations carefully. It is a responsibility.”
We also went through one of the case summaries, responded by Barrister Sami Rahman in lieu of workplace discrimination to see what he meant. It really explained everything.
